## Premise

The main focus will be on a termite "prince" who gained sentience.  
The being is born of Chaos, which is the mode through which sentient entities in this world can manifest extraordinary powers.  
The birth of the sentient termite prince will remain a mystery?  
> Maybe can provide exposition through conversations between different entities.  
> Someone ran away with technology to manifest Chaos and tried using it on themselves.  
> Possibly it is the result of the man using the tech on himself?  
> Chaos cannot be tamed, it can only be channeled. Those that try to tame Chaos will face its retribution in one form.  
> **Dwarves** were the first to try this. To tame Chaos and create slave beings to fight their wars. The beings turned against them and devastated their worlds. [Expand more on this later...]

He is born in what appears to be a derelict laboratory.
